# Profile List

This is an example project built for the purpose of testing your React (& NextJS) knowledge.

It is VERY simple, but it is working!

To get it running, install the dependencies (`yarn install`) and run (`yarn next`)!

> If you have any issues getting the project up and running, please let us know. We don't want you to get stuck on this.

## What do I do?

Basically, we want you to spend some time (at least one hour, try not to spend more than say 3 hours on this) making this project _better_. You will be graded mostly on __SKILL__ (i.e. how much can be done within the time frame) here, while also partially on creativity.

You have free rein to add whatever you want! Here are some cool ideas to get the ball rolling:

1. Add a navbar, header, and/or footer to the page
2. Style the page in a nice way (using a styling framework or from scratch, whichever works better for you)
3. Add more columns to the profile list (Profile picture, location, phone number, etc.)
4. Add a search bar (This will likely require some research into the API we are talking to: https://randomuser.me/) or the ability to filter by a parameter
5. Implement a full-profile page so that you can see more information on the person

As you can see, there is a LOT that can be done here. Happy Coding!

## FAQ

1. Is it okay to deviate from the boilerplate code provided? (Inline vs Separated CSS, Functional vs Class components, etc.)
> Absolutely! Do whatever you think is the cleanest and most optimized code that works well. Above all, we would want the finalized codebase to be _stylistically consistent_.

## Okay I finished, now what?

To send the finished product back to us, you can do 1 of 2 things:
- Make a github repo, commit your finished version, and add us (benjaminjkern & madhavsoni) as contributors
    - Or I guess you could make it public and just send us the link
- Zip up the file and email it back to us!

## When will I hear back from you?

We will try to get back to all candidates within 1 week of completion of the assignment!

Let us know if you have any other questions!

Cheers,

The Bazar Team
